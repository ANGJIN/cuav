  My role for this project was to create an object detection model that can detect drone, car, and person. At the beginning, I wrote python code that reads the video or webcam and detects objects that are defined in COCO dataset. I wrote 3 codes, which are codes that detect objects with pre-trained yolov3 and yolov3-tiny models using opencv DNN, Pytorch, and Tensorflow. Compared performance of each codes and concluded that if not using the GPU while inferring, using opencv DNN is the fastest. I ended up using yolov3 and yolov3-tiny because it is much faster than faster rcnn or mask rcnn. <br/><br/>
  
  After figuring out what framework to use, I searched for image datasets to train yolov3. I found about 2600 drone images from github and about 2600 person & car images from Pascal VOC dataset. I converted Pascal VOC dataset labels into YOLO format. While converting to YOLO format, imprecise labels were generated so I looked all images and fixed labels. After dataset was prepared, I used google colab to train custom classes. I used google colab because training process required GPU but I did not have one. Google colab provided free GPUs for 12hours per session. Training dataset took about 18 hours.<br/>
  
  In coming weeks, I will install ros in raspberry pi and upload custom-trained yolo weights, detection codes to the device. I will test how well the model detects objects. If the accuracy is low I will figure out other ways to enhance the performance. Also, I will integrate camera detetion system with ros nodes. If everything is set I will help radar team for analyzing the SAR image using machine learning. I am not familiar with ros so integrating might be difficult, but I will ask other teammates who are familiar with ros to solve the problem.

#### Kyeongnam Kim-
 My role in this project is to control drones automatically.  
I'm going to use DJI Phantom 2(Drone) and UgCS(Ground Station Software).
* UgCS: I'm currently researching how to connect laptops-smartphones-DJI Phantom2 while learning how to use UgCS. I'm going to try again because the connection between the laptop and the drone was successful, but the connection between the smartphone and the drone was unsuccessful. Also, I am going to investigate whether I can adjust ground station without my smartphone.
* DJI Phantom2: I'm learning about drone preparation and drone control with Kar Ee. According to Kar Ee, the drone will have a green light if it's calibration in the area where the GPS is caught. Since I have been banned from flying drones from K-Square's conference room, I plan to fly drone from Professor Tony's farm. I'm going to ask Professor Tony that whether I can fly drones on his farm after learning some basic drone control.
