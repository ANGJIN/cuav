**ROS in GUAVA**
  - There are four packages in GUAVA(Grab UAV Accurately) project.
    - main : Package that give orders to other packages and Receive Result from each packages.
    - radar : Package that get raw data using radar, make SAR image and classify object.
    - camera : Package that take a picture and classify object.
    - rail : Package that control movement of rail needed for making SAR image.
  - And each package consist of nodes, messages and topics.
  - Each node publishes a message to a topic or subscribes topic to get a message from other nodes.
  - Especially, I mainly implement main package. More details about nodes in main package is following
    - decision : give signal to initialize, start, end to radar, camera and rail node and get result from these nodes.
    - storage : save raw data and result data from other packages.
    - log : write log of entire system. All nodes in GUAVA publish to ‘logs’ topic.
    - web : visualize result made by decision node.

## 2.Rehearsal
  1. ROSCORE is run on the main package. The rest of the rail / radar nodes and camera nodes run a shell script to set up the execution environment. Main Raspberry Pi is localhost and Camera and Radar Raspberry Pi are configured to communicate on ROS by setting ROS_MASTER_URI to the IP address of main Raspberry Pi / PC.
  2. Each node is executed in camera and radar Raspberry Pi (by shell script named <package_name> .sh), log, storage, web nodes are executed in order in main package, finally decision node is executed. Send an init message to the operate topic.
  3. The rail and camera packages complete their initialization, and the rail node sends a message to the rail_end topic indicating that the rail has finished initializing. The decision node receiving the message goes from the init phase to the start phase.
  4. The Decision node sends a start message to the operate topic.
  5. The three nodes that received the message 1. The rail node moves the rail over 74 seconds. 2. The radar node starts collecting binary data. 2. The Camera node starts collecting data. While collecting data, the Decision node receives real-time data through the realtime_camera topic, stores it in the storage node, and passes the file path and result value to the web node to show the result_web topic.
  6. When the rail reaches the end, it posts a message to the rail_end topic that the cycle is over and the decision node that receives the message goes to the end phase.
  7. The decision node subscribed to that topic sends a message to the end topic telling the camera and radar to stop collecting data.
  8. The radar package publishes the binary data accumulated so far to the raw topic. The storage node stores the raw file.
  9. Publish for make_sar_image node to receive after conversion to IFFT and wav data.
  10. Create a SAR image and pass it to the decision node
  11. The Camera package creates a summary of the photos so far and sends a message to the summary_camera.
  12. RADAR and CAMERA publish to the result_radar and summary_camera topics, respectively, so that the Decision node receives it and delivers it to the storage node.
 
## 3.Message Definition

### Radar Package
